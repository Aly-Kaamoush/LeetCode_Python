About LeetCode 75
LeetCode 75 is a curated list of 75 essential problems that cover the most important data structures and algorithms concepts for coding interviews. This repository contains my journey through solving these problems with clean, efficient Python code.

Daily Practice Routine

Goal: Solve 1-2 problems daily
Focus: Understanding patterns and optimal solutions
Approach: Two-pointer technique, sliding window, and other essential patterns
Documentation: Each solution includes time/space complexity analysis

Key Learnings & Patterns
Two-Pointer Technique

When to use: Multiple sequences, comparison problems, merging
Time Complexity: Usually O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) additional space
Problems solved: Merge Strings Alternately

Pattern Recognition

Same direction pointers for array processing
Opposite direction pointers for palindromes/two sum
Different array pointers for merging problems
